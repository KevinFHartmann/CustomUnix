usage() {
cat <<EOT
Usage: $0 <command> <filename> ... <command> <filename>

Summary: Reads lines from standard input, and appends each line to the first file whose corresponding command returns true when run with that line as its standard input. 

eg. cat moods | $0 'grep happy' happy_file 'grep sad' sad_file 'true' misc_file
will put lines containing 'happy' into the file called 'happy file', lines
that don't contain 'happy', but do contain 'sad' into the file called 'sad_file', and all other lines into 'misc_file'.
